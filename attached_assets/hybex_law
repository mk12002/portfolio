Abstract—This paper presents HybEx-Law, a system that
blends neural models with rule-based reasoning to determine
whether someone qualifies for legal aid. The framework brings
together five components: a multitask Transformer model (En-
hancedLegalBERT), a standalone eligibility classifier, a domain
classifier, a graph-based reasoning module (LegalGAT), and
a Prolog-driven rule engine. These are coordinated by the
IntelligentHybridPredictor, which calibrates their confidence levels
using isotonic regression and combines their outputs through a
weighted ensemble. We tested 17 different model combinations
through a structured ablation study. The results show a clear
advantage when all five components are used together. This full
hybrid setup reaches an F1-score of 0.985 and a precision of
98.48\%, outperforming the best four-model neural ensemble,
which reaches an F1-score of 0.982. The study also highlights the
contribution of the symbolic module: although it performs the
weakest on its own (F1: 0.825), it consistently catches rule-specific
errors that the neural models overlook, functioning as an effective
safety layer for rare but important cases.

I. INTRODUCTION
Deciding who is entitled to legal assistance is essential
for ensuring meaningful access to justice, particularly for
groups that face social or economic disadvantages. In India,
these eligibility rules are laid out in the Legal Services
Authorities Act of 1987, which considers factors such as income
level, demographic category, including women, children, and
individuals from SC/ST communities and the nature of the
legal issue.
Reviewing each application manually takes considerable time
and resources, and the process often results in inconsistent
outcomes. These delays place added pressure on legal aid
institutions, making it clear that there is a need for tools that
can speed up eligibility checks without compromising accuracy
or transparency.
HybEx-Law was designed to address this need. It evaluates le-
gal aid eligibility by interpreting a user’s natural-language query
[2]. Instead of depending exclusively on deep learning models,
which can be opaque, or solely on rule-based systems, which
may be too rigid, the framework combines both approaches into
a unified system. It uses neural models,including variants of
LegalBERT [3] to understand free-form text and pairs them with
a symbolic reasoning layer. This layer includes a deterministic
rule engine built with SWI-Prolog [5], a legal knowledge graph
processed through a Graph Attention Network (LegalGAT),
and several specialized Transformer-based classifiers.
After receiving a user’s query and its contextual details, the
system produces a structured JSON output. This output offers a
clear eligibility decision, provides a calibrated confidence score,
and outlines the reasoning steps involved, ensuring transparency
throughout the process.
The following are this work’s primary contributions:
1) We present HybEx-Law, a five-component hybrid archi-
tecture that combines symbolic logic and neural models
to facilitate legal reasoning.
2) We create an automated orchestration system that uses
a scaled ensembling process to combine model outputs
and perform confidence calibration.
3) We perform a thorough ablation study across 17 model
combinations and show that by employing symbolic
rules as a reliable edge case safeguard, the hybrid
"expert ensemble" consistently outperforms neural-only
approaches.
The structure of HybEx-Law is described in detail, along
with the functions of each component, the training and fine-
tuning processes, and the outcomes of extensive experiments
conducted across a wide evaluation set.
II. RELATED WORK
The use of AI in the legal sector is rife with challenges,
mainly the requirement for high precision and entire explain-
ability. Our work is based on three different areas of research.
A. AI in Legal Tech
The focus of traditional legal AI was on rule-based systems
and, more recently, on information retrieval and document
analysis [7], including explainable case-based decision-support
tools and legal search interfaces that surface explicit rationales
rather than opaque scores [11], [13]. The use of deep learning
has grown exponentially; models such as BERT [3] and domain-
specific variants like LEGAL-BERT [10] and benchmark
suites such as LexGLUE [12] have been applied to tasks like
contract review, court outcome prediction, and legal document
classification [14], [15]. However, these systems struggle with
tasks requiring multi-step or transparent reasoning, because
they often cannot provide justifications that are clearly tied to
specific statutes or regulations, which is critical when deciding
whether a person should receive legal aid [11], [16], [20].
B. Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Approaches
Purely neural systems are often weak on transparent rea-
soning or verifiability, while purely symbolic systems can be
brittle and struggle with natural language ambiguity. Hybrid
Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) approaches aim to close this gap [8],
often by combining neural perception modules with symbolic
components that encode rules, constraints, or logical programs.
Recent work has explored hybrid agents for legal research
and compliance checking, where neural models retrieve or
classify documents and symbolic layers verify obligations
against formal rule bases [7], [15], [16]. Our approach is
in line with modular NeSy architectures [8], applying a neural
front-end that extracts structured information which is then
passed to a symbolic back-end for reasoning, similar in spirit
to contemporary hybrid retrieval-and-reasoning pipelines in
legal AI [11], [15]. Unlike systems that focus primarily on
reinforcement-learning-based control [9], HybEx-Law operates
by constructing explicit, sequential logical steps and prioritizes
deterministic reasoning over purely probabilistic inference.
C. Knowledge Graphs and GNNs in Law
The legal arena is not determined only by statutes, but by
the complicated relationships between them, so it is well suited
for representation as a Knowledge Graph (KG). Recently, legal
knowledge graphs have been used to find relevant case law,
represent statutory networks, and support case law analytics
and compliance analysis [7], [18], [19]. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) provide a powerful way of analyzing these relationships
and performing inference over graph-structured representations
of legal concepts, authorities, and factual entities [18]. A GNN
can capture complex patterns within a legal graph that may
be too intricate or too numerous to encode manually as rules,
such as higher-order dependencies among statutes, precedents,
and case facts [18], [19]. The novelty of HybEx-Law lies in
its integration: the GNN does not replace the symbolic logic
system but instead complements it and joins forces with other
components, including the rule-checking module, in a hybrid
ensemble that balances structured reasoning with data-driven
predictions.
III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
A. Overview
The HybEx-Law system features a hybrid and modular
architecture comprising neural, graph, and symbolic reasoning
components as shown in Fig. 1. The system consists of 5 key
factors orchestrated by a central IntelligentHybridPredictor.
The workflow is as follows:
1) A Data Preprocessor normalizes the raw query and struc-
tured metadata (e.g., income, social category), performs
entity extraction, and tokenizes the text.
2) The processed inputs are sent in parallel to the five
predictive models, which are organized into two distinct
paths (see Fig. 1): a Text Path (for neural text models)
Fig. 1. The HybEx-Law System Architecture. A query is processed by the
Data Preprocessor, then fed in parallel to five neural and symbolic models.
The Fusion & Orchestration layer arranges and merges these inputs to produce
a final decision, which is then sent to monitoring and review queues.
and a Structured Facts Path (for GNN and Prolog
models).
3) The Hybrid Orchestrator ingests the outputs (logits or
probabilities) from all five models.
4) It applies Confidence Calibration (e.g., Isotonic Regres-
sion) to align the confidence scores.
5) It combines the calibrated scores using Ensemble Logic
(e.g., weighted averaging) or applies a priority override.
6) It produces a final Decision Output (HybridPrediction)
that includes a reasoning trace, an uncertainty score,
and a "requires review" flag.
7) This output is logged.
B. Component Models
The predictive power of the system comes from five distinct
components, each designed to capture different aspects of the
legal query.
1) EnhancedLegalBERT: A Transformer that is the major
textual model. It performs multiple tasks including eligi-
bility prediction, domain classification, and uncertainty
estimation.
2) EligibilityPredictor: A one-purpose, independent, binary
classifier trained on its own eligibility. This offers a broad
range of second opinion to the multi-task model.
3) DomainClassifier:This is a single purpose independent
classifier trained only on domain classification (Trans-
former backbone). This offers a broad range of second
opinion to the multi-task model.
