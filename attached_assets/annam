Project Title: Sanchalak – An Intelligent, Multilingual Voice Assistant for Farmer Scheme Eligibility
1. Executive Summary
Sanchalak (meaning "The Operator" or "The Facilitator" in Hindi) is a voice-driven AI assistant designed to bridge the critical information gap between India's farmers and the 50+ government welfare schemes they are entitled to. Built on a hybrid AI architecture, it combines a Prolog-based deterministic rule engine for precise eligibility determination with a Large Language Model (Gemma) for human-like conversational responses. The system is multilingual, allowing farmers to interact naturally in their regional language via voice, and is designed for low-latency (<5s), making it a practical, real-time tool for bridging the digital and linguistic divide.

2. The Problem Statement
Complex & Scattered Information: India has over 50 major central and state schemes for farmers (e.g., PM-KISAN, PMFBY). Eligibility criteria are complex (land size, crop type, irrigation status, family composition), and this information is often scattered across government websites, mostly in English.

Digital & Linguistic Divide: A significant portion of India's 140 million farmer families are not digitally literate and may have limited proficiency in English or Hindi. Navigating government portals, downloading PDFs, and understanding complex rules is often impossible.

Critical Consequence: Farmers remain unaware of benefits they are entitled to, leading to missed opportunities for financial support, insurance, and resource access.

3. The Solution: Sanchalak (AgriSahayak++)
Sanchalak addresses these issues by providing a conversational interface that is:

Voice-First: Farmers can speak naturally. No typing or navigation is required.

Multilingual: Supports regional languages (e.g., Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi).

Accurate: Uses a deterministic logic engine to ensure 100% accurate eligibility checks based on official rules.

Empathetic: Uses an LLM to humanize technical results into clear, polite, and encouraging responses.

Stateful: Remembers a farmer's details across a session so they don't have to repeat themselves.

4. System Architecture & Technology Stack
Sanchalak employs a three-tier modular microservice architecture designed for scalability, performance, and maintainability.

Tier 1: Presentation Tier (Frontend)
Component: Streamlit Web Application

Function: The user's point of contact. It handles audio recording (via WebRTC), plays the audio response, and displays the chat history.

Key Technology: Streamlit for rapid, Python-based UI development.

Communication: Acts as a thin client, sending user audio and session data to the Tier 2 backend via a single POST API endpoint.

Tier 2: Application Tier (Backend & Logic Core)
Component: FastAPI Backend Server

Function: The central brain and orchestrator. It manages the entire conversation flow, coordinates between all internal and external microservices, and executes the core logic.

Key Technology: FastAPI (Asynchronous). Chosen for its high-performance I/O capabilities, allowing it to concurrently handle multiple requests and orchestrate a complex chain of network calls (STT, translation, LLM, TTS) with low latency.

Sub-Components:

NLU Module: Parses translated English text to extract structured entities (land_size, crop, etc.).

Conversation State Manager: Implements a logical graph (conceptual "Schemabot") to determine the next step (e.g., "ask for missing info" or "check eligibility").

Scheme Manager (Rule Engine Interface): A custom Python module that interfaces between the FastAPI app and the Prolog engine. It loads scheme definitions from scheme.yaml and translates them into rules.pl.

Tier 3: Data Tier (Persistence & Truth)
Component 1: EFRDB Server (Electronic Farmer Records DB)

Function: Stores farmer profiles and session state. This allows the system to remember a farmer's details (land size, crop) and provide a personalized, context-aware experience.

Technology: Likely a NoSQL database (MongoDB), storing data as JSON documents.

Component 2: Scheme Server (Rule Base)

Function: The source of truth for government scheme rules.

Technology: A collection of files managed by the backend.

scheme.yaml: Human-readable definitions of each scheme's rules (e.g., land_size >= 2, crop in [rice, wheat]). This abstraction allows policy experts to update rules without coding.

rules.pl: The auto-generated Prolog rule file, compiled from the YAML, which the logic engine runs.

External AI Services
STT (Speech-to-Text): OpenAI Whisper. Chosen for its superior accuracy in transcribing diverse regional accents and robustness to background noise.

Translation: Azure Translator. Provides reliable translation between regional languages and English.

TTS (Text-to-Speech): Azure TTS. Generates high-quality, natural-sounding neural voices in the target language.

LLM (Large Language Model): Gemma (by Google). A lightweight, open-source LLM used for human-computer interaction and response generation.

5. The Technical Breakthrough: Hybrid "Prolog + LLM" Engine
The project's most significant innovation is its hybrid approach to decision-making.

The "Logic Brain" (Prolog): Government scheme eligibility is deterministic (a farmer is either eligible or not). An LLM is non-deterministic and can hallucinate, making it unsuitable for this critical task. Sanchalak uses a Prolog-based rule engine for 100% deterministic, verifiable, and auditable eligibility checks. User data is asserted as facts, and Prolog queries the rules to provide a binary, correct answer.

The "Empathy Brain" (LLM): Prolog's output is cold and technical (e.g., eligible=[pmksy01]). The Gemma LLM is used as a "humanizer." It takes this technical result and translates it into a warm, clear, and polite conversational response in English, which is then translated for the farmer.

This hybrid model gives Sanchalak the precision of a logic engine and the conversational fluency of an LLM, a powerful combination for this use case.

6. End-to-End Data Flow (The "5-Second Journey")
User speaks: Farmer says, "Mere paas 3 acre zameen hai" (I have 3 acres of land). Streamlit records the audio (audio.wav).

API Call: Streamlit sends the audio to the FastAPI backend via POST /api/v1/conversation/query.

Orchestration (STT): FastAPI asynchronously calls the Whisper service. audio.wav -> "Mere paas 3 acre zameen hai".

Orchestration (Translation): FastAPI asynchronously calls Azure Translator. "Mere paas 3 acre zameen hai" -> "I have 3 acres of land".

Logic (NLU & State): The NLU module extracts {"land_size": 3}. This is stored in the EFRDB for the user's session. The system checks if all required info is present. If yes, it proceeds.

Logic (Prolog): The FastAPI backend asserts the farmer's facts (farmer(land_size, 3)) into the Prolog engine. The engine runs a query (eligible(Scheme)) against the loaded rules. Result: {"eligible": ["pmksy01"], "ineligible": []}.

Orchestration (LLM): FastAPI passes this result to the Gemma LLM. The LLM generates a response: "You are eligible for the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana because you have more than 2 acres of land...".

Orchestration (Translation): FastAPI asynchronously calls Azure Translator. The English response is translated back to Hindi: "Aap Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana ke liye paatra hain...".

Orchestration (TTS): FastAPI asynchronously calls Azure TTS. The Hindi text is synthesized into an audio file (response.mp3).

Response: FastAPI streams response.mp3 back to the Streamlit frontend.

Playback: Streamlit automatically plays the audio for the farmer.

This entire orchestration, involving multiple asynchronous network calls and internal logic, is optimized to complete in under 5 seconds.

7. Key Features & Innovations
Voice-to-Voice Interface: Completely removes the need for literacy or typing.

Deterministic Rule Engine (Prolog): Ensures 100% accuracy for eligibility, a critical requirement for government schemes.

Hybrid Logic+LLM Architecture: Combines the strengths of symbolic AI (precision) and generative AI (fluency).

Rule Abstraction (YAML): Allows non-programmers to update scheme rules via simple YAML files, decoupling policy from code.

High-Performance Asynchronous Backend: FastAPI orchestrates a complex, I/O-bound pipeline with low latency and high throughput.

Stateful Conversation: Remembers farmer details, allowing for multi-turn, context-aware interactions.

Production-Ready Design: Includes Docker containerization, health-check endpoints for monitoring, and modular code structure.

8. Project Impact
Sanchalak is more than a technical prototype; it's a tool with the potential to empower millions of farmers. By making information accessible through a natural, voice-based interface, it can:

Increase Scheme Enrollment: Directly connect eligible farmers with the benefits they deserve.

Reduce Bureaucratic Friction: Eliminate the need for farmers to rely on intermediaries or navigate complex portals.

Democratize Information: Provide a powerful, intelligent tool to the most marginalized and under-served population, promoting digital and financial inclusion.

9. Future Scope
Expand Language Support: Add support for more regional languages and dialects.

Document Analysis: Integrate document scanning (OCR + NLU) so farmers can upload photos of their land records for automatic data extraction.

Integration with Government APIs: Directly link to government portals to facilitate the actual application process, not just eligibility checking.

Deploy on Edge Devices: Optimize the models (Whisper, Gemma) to run on low-power devices or even offline on mobile phones for use in areas with poor connectivity.

Multi-Modal Interface: Allow for a mix of voice and text/button-based interactions.
