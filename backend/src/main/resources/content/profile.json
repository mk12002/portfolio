  "longIntro": "I'm a Cybersecurity Intern at ITC Infotech, focused on AI for Security and Security for AI. My journey started in deep ML — building Legal AI systems (HybEx-Law), multi-agent research platforms (Nexus), lung surgery digital twins (LUNA), vision-based parking systems, and healthcare audio pipelines. Now I'm applying that ML depth to cybersecurity: conducting VAPT with Burp Suite, Nmap, and sqlmap, running SOC operations with Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel, hardening cloud environments on AWS, and engineering a multi-agentic AI system for autonomous email threat neutralization. I believe the future of security is AI-native — and the future of AI must be secure.",
