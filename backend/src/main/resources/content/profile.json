  "longIntro": "I'm a cybersecurity intern at ITC Infotech learning to work at the intersection of AI and security. My journey spans building ML systems including Legal AI (HybEx-Law), multi-agent research systems (Nexus), lung surgery digital twin prototyping (LUNA), vision-based parking systems, agricultural diagnostics, and healthcare audio processing. Now I'm focused on understanding AI for security (leveraging ML for threat detection, anomaly detection) and security for AI (protecting ML systems from adversarial attacks and ensuring robust AI deployments).",
